"""Global Ctrl+Alt listener.

Ctrl+Alt is a modifier-only combo, so it cannot go through Windows'
RegisterHotKey. We install a low-level keyboard hook instead and run a small
state machine over it.

Timeline of a press:

    t0            press Ctrl+Alt
    t0 + 0.25s    engage  -> recording starts, overlay appears
    release
      before t0+0.7s   -> tap:  recording latches (hands free)
      after  t0+0.7s   -> hold: recording stops (push to talk)

Releasing before the engage delay does nothing at all, which is what keeps
ordinary Ctrl+Alt+<key> shortcuts and AltGr from tripping the recorder.
