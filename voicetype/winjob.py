"""Ties child processes to the lifetime of the app.

RealtimeSTT runs final transcription in a spawned child process. If VoiceType
dies without running its shutdown path -- Task Manager, a forced sign-out, a
crash, or an installer that restarts it -- that child is orphaned. Its parent
pipe is gone, so RealtimeSTT's poll loop raises BrokenPipeError, logs the
traceback, and immediately tries again. Forever.

That is not hypothetical. Twelve orphans were found on the development machine,
the oldest three days old, and between them they had written an 8.7 GB
stdout.log and taken the system disk down to its last few gigabytes.

No amount of Python can fix this: TerminateProcess runs no atexit handlers, no
finally blocks, and no signal handlers. The cleanup has to outlive us, so it
belongs to the operating system. We put the process in a job object marked
kill-on-close. Children inherit the job, and when the last handle to it closes
-- which Windows does for us when the process dies, however it dies -- every
process still in the job is terminated.

Call join_kill_on_close() once, in the parent, before anything is spawned.
