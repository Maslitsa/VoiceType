"""Transcription backends and the per-segment language trick.

Two backends produce the final text:

  local   faster-whisper running inside RealtimeSTT, on your CPU
  cloud   OpenAI's gpt-4o-transcribe, the model ChatGPT's voice input uses

The local backend also implements per-segment language detection. Whisper
emits one language token per utterance and decodes everything under it, so a
sentence that switches language mid-way gets the other half *translated*
rather than transcribed. Splitting the audio at pauses and letting Whisper
detect each piece separately fixes that, measured on this machine:

    "I already sent the invoice yesterday but клиент до сих пор не ответил"

    whole utterance -> "...but Client has still not answered my letter"  (wrong)
    per segment     -> "[en] I already sent the invoice yesterday but..."
                       "[ru] Клиент до сих пор не ответил на моё письмо."

It only helps when you actually pause at the switch; a seamless switch still
lands in one language. The cloud backend needs none of this.
