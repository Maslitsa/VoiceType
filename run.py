"""VoiceType entry point.

Launch with pythonw.exe so no console window ever appears.

The stream redirection below runs at import time on purpose: RealtimeSTT
transcribes in a spawned child process, and multiprocessing re-imports this
module in that child. Under pythonw.exe sys.stdout/stderr/stdin are None, and
any stray print() in a dependency would raise. Pointing them at a log file
early fixes it for the parent and every child.
